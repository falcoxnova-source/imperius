  # Avatar Storage Bucket Setup

  1. Storage Configuration
    - Creates 'avatars' bucket for user profile pictures
    - Enables public access for viewing avatars
    - Sets up storage policies for secure uploads

  2. Security Policies
    - Users can upload their own avatar (user_id folder)
    - Users can update their own avatar
    - Users can delete their own avatar
    - Anyone can view avatars (public read)

  3. Important Notes
    - Avatar files are stored in format: avatars/{user_id}/avatar.{ext}
    - Maximum file size should be handled client-side
    - Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp
